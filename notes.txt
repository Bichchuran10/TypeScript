1. The main benefit of Typescript is that it offers the ability to add static types to your Javascript code.

Example-

If we write a function to add two numbers and we pass two strings it will concatenate it in JS. But in TypeScript , 
it will throw an error as type will be set to numbers.

2.

TypeScript always points out the compilation errors at the time of development (pre-compilation).
Because of this getting runtime errors is less likely, whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language.
TypeScript supports static/strong typing. This means that type correctness can be checked at compile time. This feature is not available in JavaScript.
TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript and some additional features i.e. ES6 features. 
It may not be supported in your target browser but the TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3, ES4, and ES5 also.
